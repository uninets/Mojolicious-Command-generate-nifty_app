NAME
    Mojolicious::Command::generate::nifty_app - Generates a basic
    application with simple DBIC-based authentication!

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    This command generate an application with a DBIx::Class model and a
    simple authentication controller. The layout and style are taken from
    Ryan Bates nifty_generators.

    To generate an app run:

        mojo generate nifty_app My::Nifty::App

    This will create the directory structure with a default YAML config and
    basic testing.

        cd my_nifty_app

    To get database version and migration management you should install
    DBIx::Class::Migration.

    If installed you can use script/migration as a thin wrapper around
    dbic-migration setting lib and the correct database already. Running:

        script/migrate prepare
        script/migrate install
        script/migrate populate

    Will initialize the database according to the config.yml with the data
    from share/fixtures. So edit those to customize the default user. If you
    do not have and do not want DBIx::Class::Migrate you can initialize the
    database with:

        script/migrate --init

    Now run the test to check if everything went right.

        script/my_nifty_app test
